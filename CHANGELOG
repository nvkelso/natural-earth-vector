- Full details: http://www.naturalearthdata.com/blog/miscellaneous/natural-earth-v2-0-0-release-notes/.

- Many thanks to the individuals who contributed over the last year of development: Tom, Nathaniel, Alex Tait, Hans van der Maarel, Scott Zillmer, Mike Migurski, Daniel Huffman, Xan Gregg, Peter Bispham, Drew Noakes, Miguel Angel Vilela, Matthew Toro, Kevin Pickell, Shawn Allen, Robert Coup, Iain, Leo, and more! Thanks also to Stamen thru the Knight Foundation Citytracking grant for sponsoring a portion of this work including remastering geometries for better PostGIS import, the move to Github, and adopting semantic versioning.

GENERAL

- UPDATED:  NATURAL_EARTH_UPDATE_2.0.0 - This release focuses on 7 major areas: 
1) Economic geography: adds global roads, railroads, ports, airports, and time zones to 
show how people are interconnected and goods route.
2) Remastered geometries: fixes topological errors at 1:10 to 1:1,000 scales in the basic 
coastline, ocean, land, admin-0, and admin-1 related themes for files in the the 1:10m 
scaleset. By removing self-intersections, sliver polygons, and adjusting offset polygons, 
Natural Earth imports into more GIS software (like PostGIS) and will be easier to 
maintain. The coastline is adjusted to better conform to ~1:3,000,000 satellite imagery. 
Because of all these changes, some raster themes are also updated. Land, ocean, and minor 
islands all build topologically by scripting ingredients, as do the admin-0 and admin-1 
cultural themes.
3) Introduce Gray Earth rasters. Worldwide terrain depicted monochromatically in shades of 
gray. It combines shaded relief and regionally adjusted hypsography that emphasizes both 
high mountains and the micro terrain found in lowlands. View new raster »
4) New file name and field name schemas. Full adoption of ne_10m_theme_name.shp file names 
with `ne_` prefix to allow better import into GeoDB and PostGIS storage, lowercase field 
(column) names instead of MiXeD and UPPER cased names, and use of consistent `name` field 
(versus name1).
5) Address user submitted bug reports, ~25 since the 1.4 release, and earlier.
6) Moved to Github for the backend versioned file management and coordination. Includes 
scripts to package updates and auto-create derived themes. 
7) Adopt semantic versioning. Know, by theme, the level of effort needed to update your 
maps when Natural Earth data updates are released. 
* Other notable changes:
All themes now include README and VERSION files. The admin-0 attributes have more veracity 
and now includes nested disputed areas (was a sidecar). Adds continent, region, subregion 
codes. Adds versions of country and admin-1 without boundary lakes.  All places and parts 
of places have population and GDP estimates. The populated places pop_max and pop_min 
attributes are now fully built out for all records (pop max is for the metropolitan area, 
pop_min is for the incorporated city of the same name). populated places now include 
rank_max and rank_min for simple town size grading. All instances of name1 have been 
changed to name, name to name, name2 to name_alt. Vertexes were added to many themes to 
allow them to project into conics smoothly (they're back!). All field (column) names are 
now generally in the order of: scalerank, featurecla, name, name_alt, natscale, 
labelrank, *.

            Name_alt Attribute changes: Several dozen missing strokes weights were 
            corrected, 1/2 dozen scaleRanks. One new mystery river segment.
- CHANGED:  1. The stream marked as the Parana in Argentina has been renamed: the lower 
            stretch is the lower portion of the remains Parana, then the Paraguay upstream 
            from the confluence of the Paraguay and Parana. Then Cuiaba upstream from its 
            confluence with the Paraguay, on up to the source.

            from the Okanogan at Oroville, WA, and then proceed west & north into Canada, 
            where it remains.
- CHANGED:  Where the Snake River joins the Columbia River, part of the path of the 
            Columbia was marked as the Snake.
- CHANGED:  Sweden river funk: ‘Dallven’ instead of the correct ‘Dalälven‘. A few others 
            like that, need more clarification. via Graham Asher
- CHANGED:  IJssel river in Netherlands was incorrectly named Irrawaddy via Nathaniel
- NEW:      North America Rivers supplement - Database structure changes: Name1 is now 
            Name, Name2 is now Name_alt Removed River, abbreviated Creek, North, South, 
            East, West, Branch, etc. in the Name column to make consistent with the basic
            Rivers theme. Preserved the original in Name_full.

- CHANGED:  Geographic lines at 10m, 50m, and 110m demotes the pre 1995 date line segment
            down to 100, giving Null Island company. Display column has been removed, Name
            column added with shorter version of the old Display name. Name_Long contains

- CHANGED:  All US state boundary fixes: R.I.-Mass., Va.-N.C. now bends south in the 
            middle., Del.-Penn. boundary bends differently., Tenn.-Ala.-Ga.-Miss., 
            Kan.-Col., Neb.-Co., Neb.-Wy., S.D.-Wy., S.D.-Mont., N.D.-Mont., Iowa-Mo., 
            Modify the DC shape a bit to better match more detailed zooms and remove part
            of the adm-1 line on the shore.
- CHANGED:  The ADM1NAME Ãstfold corrected to Østfold.
- CHANGED:  Zhejiang – Should be labeled as the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. Is part of
            Australia. RENAMED Niue – Is not part of Australia, but independent. 
            Associated with New Zealand. DELETED as admin-1 units are not shown for small
            countries. Kerguelen Islands are part of France DELETED as admin-1 units are
            not shown for small countries.
- CHANGED:  Niassa Province in Mozambique is incorrectly spelled as ‘Nassa’. ‘Niassa’ is
            there as a varname, but the province has never been called ‘Nassa’.
- CHANGED:  Populated places (10m, 50m and 110m) - Norwegian cities, in whole related to
            the special characters æ, ø and å. The following corrections should be made: 
            Baerum -> Bærum, Svolvaer -> Svolvær, Tonsberg -> Tønsberg and 
            Vadso -> Vadsø.
- CHANGED:  Baguio City in the Philippines is still the defacto summer location of the 
            supreme court (judiciary branch of government), a similar situation as Chile
            and a couple other countries, but is now coded as “Admin-0 cap alt”. However, 
            Quezon City and Pasay City are downgraded from Admin-0 capital alt to 
            “Populated place” as the recent constitution states that the entire admin-1 
            unit of Manila is the national capital and they fall inside that feature. 
- CHANGED:  The place name Wiener Neustadt in Austria (that is the proper name of the 
            city) had the wrong NAME attribute “Wiener”.
- CHANGED:  Across the Mekong from Nakhon Phanom (Thailand), Natural Earth has a 
            settlement marked “Khammouan” in Laos. Khammouan(e) is the name of a province.
            The actual city across the river appears to be the capital of said province,
            Thakhek.
- CHANGED:  San Carlos moved east out of Lake Nicaragua.
- CHANGED:  Primarily in Iran, Egypt, and Lebanon. “Name in NEV” >> “Should be”: 
            Dayr az Zawr >> Dayr az Azwr, Khoramabad >> Khorramabad, 
            Shahr E Kord >> Shar e Kord, Zagizig >> Zagazig, Damanhr >> Damanhur, 
            Nabatiyet et Tahta >> Nabatiye et Tahta
- CHANGED:  Greeneville, NC should be Greenville, NC
- CHANGED:  Two point features labeled Bayankhongor in Mongolia. Kept the ’southern’ 
            point, delete the northern one. Southern feature featureType changed to 
            “Admin-1 cap”.

            provided with large lakes erased 
- CHANGED:  Added SameAsCity column to indicate if the label should be placed only at a 
            certain natural scale since the adm-1 name is the same (or very similar) to 
            the adm-1 capital populated place point label.
