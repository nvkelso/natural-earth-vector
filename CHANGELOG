GENERAL

- UPDATED:  NATURAL_EARTH_UPDATE_2.0.0 - All instances of name1 have
            been changed to name, name to name, name2 to name_alt. Vertexes were
            added to many themes to allow them to project into conics smoothly.
            All field (column) names are now lowercase and generally in the
            order of: scalerank, featurecla, name, name_alt, natscale,
            labelrank, *. Fixes topology errors in all 10m files excepting some 
            bathymetry themes. Introduces a new "gray" relief raster series.

            of the Sakonnet River and the city of Newport, and just south of Fall 
            River, MA.

            Modify the DC shape a bit to better match more detailed zooms and remove part
            of the adm-1 line on the shore.
- CHANGED:  The ADM1NAME Ãstfold corrected to Østfold.
- CHANGED:  Zhejiang – Should be labeled as the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. Is part of
            Australia. RENAMED Niue – Is not part of Australia, but independent.

            not shown for small countries.
- CHANGED:  Niassa Province in Mozambique is incorrectly spelled as ‘Nassa’. ‘Niassa’ is
            there as a varname, but the province has never been called ‘Nassa’.
- CHANGED:  Populated places (10m, 50m and 110m) - Norwegian cities, in whole related to
            the special characters æ, ø and å. The following corrections should be made: 
            Baerum -> Bærum, Svolvaer -> Svolvær, Tonsberg -> Tønsberg and 
            Vadso -> Vadsø.
- CHANGED:  Baguio City in the Philippines is still the defacto summer location of the 
            supreme court (judiciary branch of government), a similar situation as Chile
            and a couple other countries, but is now coded as “Admin-0 cap alt”. However, 
            Quezon City and Pasay City are downgraded from Admin-0 capital alt to 
            “Populated place” as the recent constitution states that the entire admin-1 
            unit of Manila is the national capital and they fall inside that feature. 
- CHANGED:  The place name Wiener Neustadt in Austria (that is the proper name of the 
            city) had the wrong NAME attribute “Wiener”.

            shoreline to promote more realistic auto labeling. Other changes.
- CHANGED:  Label points and elevation points changed.
- CHANGED:  Geographic lines: Added new Kiribati date line extension (and clipped to ±180 
            ±90 bounding box).
- CHANGED:  Parks: Two new U.S. National Park Service units added as the system expands 
            to 384 total. Data fields updated so Name can be used for labels and UnitName

            of St. Helena from erroneous position on South Georgia I. in 50m and 110m

            shorter 2 to 3 digit “postal” codes to ease labeling (US, Canada, Mexico, 
            Australia. Guessed at rest based on HASC/ISO codes). 
- CHANGED:  Admin-1 there is some indication provided when to alternate these based on 
            labelRank and scaleRank. 
- CHANGED:  Admin01 region coding has also been provided for UK and US, could expand in 
            the future (address inconsistency in France and Italy in particular where 
            Natural Earth continues to show admin 1 regions rather than departments).
- CHANGED:  States and provinces (both polygons and lines) now have correct ADM0_A3 codes 
            and use the same MAP_COLOR column as the adm-0 in all scale sets.

            provided with large lakes erased 
- CHANGED:  Added SameAsCity column to indicate if the label should be placed only at a 
            certain natural scale since the adm-1 name is the same (or very similar) to 
            the adm-1 capital populated place point label. 
- CHANGED:  Added scale ranking to adm-1 lines so they can appear in tandem with the polys.
- CHANGED:  Countries with notable admin-1 changes: Algeria, Australia, Bangladesh,

            remain outstanding.,

            have coincidental start-end points: Germany to Mongolia, Panama to Australia 
            and Yemen. Ethiopia. Taiwan. Others.
